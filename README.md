Description of what is passed in
===

Here, we have included the index.html that has the code, a booklet, and a link to the YouTube video.

The link to the github pages can be found here: [GithubIO](https://njwood.github.io/final/)

We have an image folder with the images used in the final page presentation. There is the data_spices csv with all the data. There is also the finalCuisineMap.geoJSON which is over custom geoJSON file. The .idea is carrier over from before we scrapped the react server, detailed more in the booklet.


Please excuse that the assignment is slightly late. As you know, we were really struggling with the geoJSON file, and only today were we able to get it work. Thank you.
